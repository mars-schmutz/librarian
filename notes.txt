In this moment of enlightenment, let me for once and all figure out shelf_row_width and module_width

shelf_row_width controls the gap between each shelf of books
module_width controls the dimensions of the shelf itself

the gap gets added to the shelf dimensions so we don't have shelves spilling out into each other
